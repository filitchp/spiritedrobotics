Pin Connections for the ATMega328

Port B

    PIN	FUNC		CONNECTION
    0	ICP			LED
    1	OC1A		LED
    2	SS/OC1B    	LED
    3	MOSI	    Connected directly ICP header
    	Note*	    other connections must go through a 4.7KOhm resistor to prevent interference with the programmer 
    4	MISO	    Connected directly ICP header
    	SPI-MISO    Connected through 4.7KOhm resistor to led-strip data input
    5	SCK	    	Connected directly to ICP header
    	SCK	    	Connected through 4.7KOhm resistor to led-strip clock input 
    6 	XTAL1		XTAL
    7	XTAL2		XTAL


Port C

    PIN	FUNC		CONNECTION
    0	ADC0		Motor 1 sense voltage (10mA/mV)
    1	ADC1		Motor 2 sense voltage (10mA/mV)
    2	ADC2		Testpoint
    3	ADC3		Testpoint
    4	ADC4/SDA	Testpoint
    5	ADC5/SCL	Testpoint
    6	RESET	    This is not configurable. Must be tied high with 4.7 KOhm resistor and debounced with a .1 - 1 uF cap.
    	RESET	    Connect to ICP header
		RESET	    Can add button for manual reset (pull pin to ground)


Port D

    PIN	FUNC		CONNECTION
    0	Rx	    	USART Rx
    1	Tx	    	USART Tx
    2	INT0		Testpoint
    3	INT1		Testpoint
    4	PD4	    	Direction pin for motor1
    5	OC0B	    PWM pin for motor1
    6	OC0A	    PWM pin for motor2
    7	PD7	    	Direction pin for motor2

Misc
	ADC6			Extra Opamp output
	ADC7			Testpoint
