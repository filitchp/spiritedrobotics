Todo:
- Figure out motor driving
	- PWM direction or enable
- Start prototyping on the avr
	- Get powersupply and breadboard header
- Figure out if we want 1 or 2 uarts
	- Driving uart with raspberry pi
		- Can we directly use the onboard ethernet?
- Select avr chip (based on requirements)
	- Order a few of the them in a dip package for prototyping
- Meet Tuesday at 11.
	- Email invite to everyone
		
- Get everyone on google code group
	- Setup email notifications when commits made

- Setup irc chatroom.

- Ideas:
	
	- Use single bus with a buffer that can be disabled
		- Buffer keep signal strong over long distances
		- Enable allows us to determine the order of towers on the network
	- Semi-circle tower configuration
	- Towers modular
	- Sync spray to music / lights (bellagio)
	- Lazy susan to move cup into firing range and to customer
		- Doesn't have to be full circle. could be single beam with counter weight or multiple beams with cups on end (spokes of tire)spoke could have hole that cup would drop into
		- Rubber washer to set height and adjut for different cup sizes
	- Cup loader could drop cups on to lazy susan, or uses arm to grab cup and set it on the lazy susan
	
	- Ice machine? relay to control the dispensing of ice?
		- Digital scale to measure how much ice?
