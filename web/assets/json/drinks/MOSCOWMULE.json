  "description" : "Invented in 1941 by John G. Martin, this cocktail is made with vodka, ginger beer and lime. It was a popular drink during 1950s and a big hit among the Hollywood hipsters, who frequented the famous tavern on the Sunset Strip in the United States. The drink is served on the rocks poured over ice in a copper cup. The copper mugs were especially made for this drink and marketed around the country. At that time Vodka was a big craze in the US which made the popularity of this drink to soar more.",
