Pin Connections for the ATMega328


Port B

    Pin
    0
    1
    2	SS	    Currently configured as slave select by SPI. It is not needed, but if left as input, must be tied high with a resistor.
    3	MOSI	    Connected directly ICP header
    	Note*	    other connections must go through a 4.7KOhm resistor to prevent interference with the programmer 
    4	MISO	    Connected directly ICP header
    	SPI-MISO    Connected through 4.7KOhm resistor to led-strip data input
    5	SCK	    Connected directly to ICP header
    	SCK	    Connected through 4.7KOhm resistor to led-strip clock input

Port C

    Pin
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6	RESET	    This is not configurable. Must be tied high with 4.7 KOhm resistor and debounced with a .1 - 1 uF cap.
    	RESET	    Connect to ICP header
	RESET	    Can add button for manual reset (pull pin to ground)

Port D

    Pin
    0	Rx	    USART Rx
    1	Tx	    USART Tx
    2
    3
    4	PD4	    Direction pin for motor1
    5	OC0B	    PWM pin for motor1
    6	OC0A	    PWM pin for motor2
    7	PD7	    Direction pin for motor2
