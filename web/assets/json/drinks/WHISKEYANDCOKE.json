  "description" : "The term 'Jack and Coke' was used in some combined advertising for Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola, and several products were created as part of this marketing campaign, including bar signs and taps. Around 1996, Jack Daniel's released a canned beverage called 'Jack Daniel's and Cola', a mixed beverage of the same type as Jack and Coke, in several markets in the South Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand.",
