	Done:
	    
	    Breadboarded avr,
		Driving LED strip
		Driving PWM


	ToDo:
	    
	    Ron: protocol
	    Dan: schematic
	    Ryan: state machine + motor driver on breadboard


	    Get cyrstal
	
	    Raspi,
		webserver
		communication working

	    Board Layout

	Todo:

	figure out motor driving
		pwm direction or enable

	start prototyping on the avr
		get powersupply and breadboard header

	Figure out if we want 1 or 2 uarts

	Driving uart with raspberry pi
		can we directly use the onboard ethernet?
		
	Select avr chip (based on requirements)
		Order a few of the them in a dip package for prototyping
		
	Meet Tuesday at 11.
		Email invite to everyone
		
	get everyone on google code group
		setup email notifications when commits made

	setup irc chatroom.

	Ideas:
	
	use single bus with a buffer that can be disabled
		buffer keep signal strong over long distances
		enable allows us to determine the order of towers on the network
	
	semi-circle tower configuration
	
	towers modular
	
	sync spray to music / lights (bellagio)
	
	lazy susan to move cup into firing range and to customer
		doesn't have to be full circle. could be single beam with counter weight or multiple beams with cups on end (spokes of tire)
		spoke could have hole that cup would drop into
			rubber washer to set height and adjut for different cup sizes
			
	cup loader could drop cups on to lazy susan, or uses arm to grab cup and set it on the lazy susan
	
	ice machine? relay to control the dispensing of ice?
		digital scale to measure how much ice?
